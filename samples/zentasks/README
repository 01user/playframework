This sample uses following techs:
	- Less for Css
	- Coffeescript for Js
	- jQuery and underscore as Js libs
	- Backbone for MVC
	- Play reverse routing in Js

-----------------------------------------------
Note about front-end MVC
-----------------------------------------------
If you're used to Backbone.js, you may be
confused by the absence of models, but the goal
of this sample is to demonstrate some features
of Play including the template engine.
I'm not using client-side templating nor models
for this purpose, and I do not recommend this
behavior for real life projects.
