-----------------------
PLAY AS AN HTTP LIBRARY
-----------------------
this project demonstrates how play scales down by allowing users to utilize play as HTTP layer in existing, vanilla sbt project (or maven).

(Notice: there is nothing play specific about this project, no app, conf folder.)

-----------------
HOW TO RUN THE APP
------------------

1) build play locally

2) assuming you have sbt installed you can run it like
sbt -Dsbt.ivy.home=<myplayroot/repository> run

(Note: once a mini app aware play version will be uploaded into an ivy repository the -D parameter won't be necessary)

3) hit http://localhost:9000/hello
